# The NXS GTFS
This is the working directory that NXS uses to create our GTFS files for public consumption. The conversion from [OSM file](https://github.com/NXS-Detroit/NXS-OpenStreetMap) uses ShadowFoxNixill's [GTFS maker](https://github.com/ShadowFoxNixill/GTFS-Finalizer).

The actual file can be found on the [releases](https://github.com/NXS-Detroit/NXS-GTFS/releases) page.

# How to open
This section is still tbd. If you know a solution that's free-to-use, ideally open-source, and runs locally, raise an issue or pull request to modify this section. Don't submit anything about adding the file to a public database; those types of databases assume that the systems being added actually exist.

# Usage in projects
If you want to use this in a project, read the [license](LICENSE.md).
